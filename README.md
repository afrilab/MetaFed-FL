## 📖 Overview

**MetaFed** is a federated learning (FL) framework designed for **Metaverse infrastructures**, integrating:

- **Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL):** dynamic client orchestration  
- **Privacy-preserving FL:** homomorphic encryption and differential privacy  
- **Carbon-aware scheduling:** resource orchestration aligned with renewable energy  

MetaFed jointly optimizes **performance, privacy, and sustainability** across distributed systems.
